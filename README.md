# GNU/Linux dotfiles

Dotfiles are files that usually store configurations for your system or programs installed on your system. Their name is derived from
the dot in front of the files'names. This repository's main objective is to store my personal dotfiles, in case of interest in my setup, or
in case of system/hardware failure.

## Credits

Most of what I do GNU/Linux-wise is heavily inspired by Luke Smith's (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) and 
Derek Taylor's (GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1) work on YouTube. Huge thanks to them for their contributions to the greater public.
